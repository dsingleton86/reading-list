# reading-list

Taking inspiration from [Jamie Rubin's reading list](https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list), I have begun to document my own reading list [here](reading.md).

```markdown
^ denotes a re-read
@ indicates an audiobook
+ shows the book was digital (typically on Kindle)
```

Only finished books are logged and they are recorded in the order they were completed.
I am indicating re-reads, even if the previous ocassions are before this list began.

## Checklists

I am using a number of checklists to keep tracking of my reading of certain authors works.  Here are my current lists so far:

- Stephen King, which can be seen [here](stephen-king.md), sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King_bibliography#Novels).

- Discworld, [checklist](discworld.md), sourced from [terrypratchettbooks.com](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/discworld-characters/).

- Harlan Coben [checklist](harlan-coben.md), sourced from 

Using these lists as inspiration, and marking books with a `[x]` (checkbox) when completed.
