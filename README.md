# reading-list

Taking inspiration from [Jamie Rubin's reading list](https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list), I have begun to document my own reading list [here](reading.md).

```markdown
^ denotes a re-read
@ indicates an audiobook
+ shows the book was digital (typically on Kindle)
```

Only finished books are logged and they are recorded in the order they were completed.
I am indicating re-reads, even if the previous ocassions are before this list began.

I have also put together a list from The Guardian's '[The 100 Best Novels Written in English](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/17/the-100-best-novels-written-in-english-the-full-list)' which can be seen [here](top-100-guardian.md).
And a list of Novel's by Stephen King, which can be seen [here](stephen-king.md), sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King_bibliography#Novels).

Using these lists as inspiration, and marking books with a ~~strikethrough~~ when completed.
