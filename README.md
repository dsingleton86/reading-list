# reading-list
 
Taking inspiration from Jamie Rubin's reading list (https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list) I have begun to document my own reading list here.

```
^ denotes a re-read
@ indicates an audiobook
+ shows the book was digital (typically on Kindle)
```

Only finished books are logged and they are logged in the order they were completed.
